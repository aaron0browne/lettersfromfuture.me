We drove a lot through the beautiful countryside and saw a lot of different animals: cattle, deer, birds, dolphins, and sheep. Sheep everywhere!\nAt one beautiful camping site, we saw cattle in fog in the very early morning and took a picture of it. The image now has the title \u0026ldquo;Rindviehcher im Nebel\u0026rdquo;, a quite funny German phrase that means cattle in the fog.\nWe arrived by car via the Eurotunnel Calais-Folkstone and drove the west coast to the north, visited the Isle of Skye (everyone should\u0026rsquo;ve seen this place before death), headed over to the north to Durness and took the north and east coast roads to Lindisfarne.\nOn our last day, we visited Dover Castle - an ancient castle complex. The Romans built one of the first buildings, a lighthouse which still can be visited. Dover Castle was also used during both World Wars.\nBest vacation ever!\nYeah, I could write a whole book about this fantastic journey\u0026hellip; But we\u0026rsquo;re here for the cool Bilberry Theme ;-)\n","iconClass":"fa-camera","objectID":"a74e386909fcbf1a7db33a23855f9c05","tags":["Scotland","Glennfinnan Viaduct","Eilean Donan Castle"],"title":"My Trip to Scotland","type":"gallery","url":"/lettersfromfuture.me/gallery/my-trip-to-scotland/"},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":"Kilez More is a great Austrian musician.
